# Flatiron Trader


This is a trading simulator that allows users to buy and sell several cryptocurrencies at live market prices. Users can track the performance of their portfolio, view historical data charts, and compete against other users. This application utilizes React and Redux on the front end along with a Rails back end. Additionally, the site  implements web sockets in order to receive live aggregate cryptocurrency pricing.
